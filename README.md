Calculator
==========

Challenge: Write a simple, browser-based calculator.

* Find visual assets from the web or create your own in order to make the look.

* The calculator should perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication operations and should support floating point numbers.
 
* The calculator should also be able to store a single floating point value in memory for later retrieval.  (Most calculators have a store-to-memory, retrieve-from-memory, and clear-memory buttons)
 
* Create the calculator in HTML and Javascript. The finished product should be functional in Chrome and Firefox without an internet connection. You may use a framework or library if you want. The core logic of the application however must be your own original work.
